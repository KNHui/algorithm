# Algorithm

Algorithm source code and description management repository

## Usage

This repository contains the source code and description of the algorithm problem.

- The description is easy to understand after reading the problem.

- In the description, the range is indicated as follows.

  ```
  (a, b) = {x ∈ X: a < x < b}
  [a, b) = {x ∈ X: a ≤ x < b}
  [a, ∞) = {x ∈ X: a ≤ x}
  (-∞, b] = {x ∈ X: x ≤ b}
  ```

- If you set one tab to have 4 spaces, the indentation will look right. In GitHub, not the source code editor, You can append '?ts=4' to the URL to change the tab-size to 4.  
   Example: [https://github.com/KNHui/algorithm/blob/master/solve/B1005.cpp?ts=4](https://github.com/KNHui/algorithm/blob/master/solve/B1005.cpp?ts=4)

- All characters in this repository are encoded in UTF-8.

## File name

- Problem of ALGOSPOT

  ```
  Problem ID
  ```

- Problem of Baekjoon, LeetCode and programmers
  The first letter of the file name is the first letter of the site name. Then the problem number follows.
  ```
  First letter of site name + problem number
  ```
